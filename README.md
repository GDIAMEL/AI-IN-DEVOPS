# AI-Powered Bug Triage & Fix Suggestion Tool

**Building Intelligent Software Solutions**

This tool automates bug classification, recommends targeted fixes, and analyzes historical bug data using AI and NLP techniques. It's designed to enhance decision-making and reduce developer workload in software maintenance.

---

## Key Features

### Intelligent Bug Classification
- Analyzes bug reports using NLP-like techniques.
- Automatically determines severity:
  - `Critical`, `High`, `Medium`, `Low`.
- Categorizes bugs by type:
  - `UI`, `Database`, `API`, `Performance`, etc.

### Fix Suggestions
- Matches bugs against a historical bug database.
- Provides specific fix recommendations with **confidence scores**.
- Suggests best practices based on bug categories.

### Historical Data Analysis
- Uses a simulated database of resolved bugs for machine learning.
- Performs pattern matching to identify similar issues.
- Tracks success rate of past fixes with simple statistics.

## How to Use with Your API Key

> **Note**: This demo uses a simulated backend. You can enhance it with your actual AI/NLP API services.

### Integration Steps

#### 1. Google AI / Gemini API
- Replace the simulated analysis logic with:
  ```python
  response = requests.post(
      'https://generativelanguage.googleapis.com/v1beta/models/text-bison-001:generateText',
      headers={'Authorization': f'Bearer YOUR_API_KEY'},
      json={ 'prompt': bug_report, 'temperature': 0.5 }
  )

#### 2. Enhanced NLP Capabilities
Use your API key to integrate services like:

- Google NLP API

- OpenAI GPT API

Hugging Face Transformers

#### 3. Real-Time Learning from Your Bug Tracker
Connect to real bug trackers like:

- GitHub Issues API

- Jira REST API

Map fields such as title, description, labels, and status.

# Ethical Reflection

This tool can streamline software maintenance, but it also raises important concerns:

Could AI recommendations introduce bias or false confidence?

What are the risks of automating security-related fix suggestions?

Will AI reduce the role of junior developers in the future?
